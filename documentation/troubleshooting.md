## Hardware Issues

### ESP32 Won't Power On

**Symptoms:**
- No LED activity on the ESP32
- Cannot upload code
- No serial output

**Solutions:**
1. Check USB cable connection
2. Try a different USB cable
3. Verify USB port functionality by connecting another device
4. Check for physical damage on the ESP32 board
5. Try a different USB port or computer

### Intermittent Power Issues

**Symptoms:**
- ESP32 resets randomly
- Inconsistent behavior

**Solutions:**
1. Use a more stable power supply
2. Add a capacitor (470μF-1000μF) between VIN and GND
3. Check for loose connections on the breadboard
4. Ensure the USB cable is firmly connected

### Connection Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Components don't respond
- Erratic behavior

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check all wiring against the wiring diagram
2. Ensure jumper wires are firmly connected
3. Check for bent pins on the ESP32 or fingerprint sensor
4. Test individual connections with a multimeter if available
5. Rebuild the circuit on a clean breadboard

## Fingerprint Sensor Problems

### Sensor Not Detected

**Symptoms:**
- "Did not find fingerprint sensor" message
- Communication errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check TX/RX connections - ensure they're crossed correctly (RX to TX, TX to RX)
2. Verify the sensor is getting power (3.3V and GND connections)
3. Try resetting the ESP32 while keeping the sensor powered
4. Ensure the fingerprint sensor is compatible with the code (R305 or similar)
5. Try adjusting the baud rate in the code (some sensors use 9600 instead of 57600)

### Poor Fingerprint Recognition

**Symptoms:**
- Frequent "Fingerprint not found" messages
- Inconsistent matching

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure fingers are clean and dry when scanning
2. Try enrolling the same finger multiple times with different IDs
3. Place finger centrally on the sensor
4. Apply consistent pressure - not too light, not too heavy
5. Clean the sensor surface with a soft, lint-free cloth
6. Re-enroll fingerprints with better quality

### Enrollment Failures

**Symptoms:**
- "Image conversion to template failed" messages
- Unable to complete enrollment process

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your finger remains in the same position for both scans
2. Clean both your finger and the sensor surface
3. Try a different finger
4. Check if the sensor memory is full (typical capacity is 127-162 fingerprints)
5. Increase delay between first and second scan

## WiFi Connection Issues

### Cannot Connect to WiFi

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to connect to WiFi" message
- Red LED blinking multiple times during startup

**Solutions:**
1. Verify WiFi credentials (SSID and password) in the code
2. Check if the WiFi network is in range and operational
3. Ensure your WiFi is 2.4GHz (ESP32 may not connect to 5GHz networks)
4. Restart your WiFi router
5. Try connecting to a mobile hotspot to rule out ESP32 issues

### Unstable WiFi Connection

**Symptoms:**
- Frequent reconnection attempts
- Intermittent Firebase upload failures

**Solutions:**
1. Move the system closer to the WiFi router
2. Reduce interference from other electronic devices
3. Use an external antenna for the ESP32 if available
4. Implement more robust reconnection code with longer delays
5. Consider using a mesh network or WiFi extender for better coverage

## Firebase Connection Problems

### Cannot Connect to Firebase

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to upload attendance" messages
- Firebase-specific error messages

**Solutions:**
1. Verify FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH values in the code
2. Ensure your Firebase project is active and not in maintenance
3. Check if Realtime Database is enabled in your Firebase project
4. Verify your Firebase database security rules allow write access
5. Check your Firebase quota usage

### Upload Failures

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to upload attendance" with specific Firebase error reasons
- Inconsistent data in Firebase

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection stability
2. Verify the database path structure in your code
3. Ensure you haven't exceeded Firebase free tier limits
4. Check timestamp formatting in the code
5. Increase the number of upload retries in the code

## System Operation Issues

### Inaccurate Time Recording

**Symptoms:**
- Timestamps in Firebase don't match actual time
- Time drift over operation period

**Solutions:**
1. Update the NTP server address if needed
2. Set the correct timezone offset in `timeClient.setTimeOffset()`
3. Ensure ESP32 can reach NTP servers (check firewall settings)
4. Implement more frequent NTP updates
5. Consider adding a real-time clock (RTC) module for offline time

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- ESP32 crashes after running for a while
- "Stack canary watchdog triggered" or memory errors

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce global variable usage
2. Free up memory after Firebase operations
3. Check for memory leaks in the loop
4. Implement better error handling that doesn't leave resources open
5. Use ESP32's PSRAM if available

## Debug Methods

### Serial Monitor Debugging

The code includes serial output for debugging. To use it effectively:

1. Connect ESP32 to computer
2. Open Arduino IDE Serial Monitor at 115200 baud
3. Monitor the output for error messages and status updates
4. Send commands via Serial Monitor:
   - `enroll:ID` - To enroll a new fingerprint with specified ID
   - `verify` - To switch to verification mode

### LED Indicators

Use the LED indicators to diagnose issues without a computer:

- **Red LED blinking once** - Fingerprint not recognized
- **Red LED blinking twice** - Firebase upload failure
- **Red LED blinking three times** - Fingerprint sensor initialization error
- **Red LED blinking five times** - WiFi connection failure
- **Green LED blinking** - Successful operation
- **Blue LED solid** - Processing in progress

### Checking Sensor Status

To verify the fingerprint sensor is working correctly:

1. Create a simple test sketch that only initializes the sensor
2. Check if the sensor parameters (capacity, etc.) are reported correctly
3. Test basic fingerprint image capture without matching

### Network Testing

For network connectivity issues:

1. Modify the code to ping a reliable server (like google.com)
2. Monitor response times and packet loss
3. Add more detailed network status reporting to the serial output

### Firebase Debug Viewer

To directly observe Firebase data:

1. Enable Firebase debug mode in your code:
   ```cpp
   Firebase.setDebugMode(true);
