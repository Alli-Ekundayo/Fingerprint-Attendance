Your task is to design and implement an IoT-based fingerprint attendance system using an Arduino ESP32. The project involves hardware integration, backend development, and programming the ESP32 to interact with Firebase. Below are the detailed requirements:

System Overview:

Objective: Create a system that uses a fingerprint sensor to record attendance. The ESP32 should process fingerprint data and communicate attendance records to a Firebase backend.

Components: Arduino ESP32, fingerprint sensor (e.g., R305 or equivalent), WiFi connectivity, and Firebase for the backend database.

Hardware Integration:

Circuit Design: Develop a wiring diagram that connects the fingerprint sensor to the Arduino ESP32. Clearly indicate all necessary connections, including power supply, data lines (TX/RX), and any required resistors or additional components.

Component Specifications: List the model numbers and technical specifications for the ESP32 and fingerprint sensor, ensuring compatibility and reliable communication.

Arduino Programming:

Fingerprint Enrollment and Verification: Write Arduino code to:

Enroll new fingerprints and store templates in the sensorâ€™s memory.

Verify a scanned fingerprint against stored templates.

WiFi Communication: Implement code that connects the ESP32 to a WiFi network.

Firebase Integration: Develop routines to:

Format and send attendance data (user ID, timestamp, status) to Firebase.

Handle errors in communication and retry failed transmissions.

Code Quality: Ensure that the Arduino code is modular, well-commented, and follows best practices for embedded programming.

Backend Development (Firebase):

Database Setup: Configure a Firebase project and set up a real-time database (or Firestore) to store attendance records.

Data Structure: Design a clear data schema that records user identification, timestamps, and fingerprint verification status.

Security and Authentication: Implement Firebase security rules to protect the data. Optionally, add user authentication if the system requires secure access.

API Integration: Ensure that the ESP32 code properly formats data for Firebase and handles API responses, including error handling.

Documentation:

Step-by-Step Guide: Provide comprehensive documentation that explains the hardware setup, wiring diagram, software installation, and configuration of both the Arduino code and the Firebase backend.

Troubleshooting Tips: Include common issues and debugging tips for both hardware and software integration.

Testing and Validation:

Test Cases: Outline test cases to verify:

Correct fingerprint enrollment and matching.

Reliable WiFi connection and data transmission.

Integrity and security of data stored in Firebase.

Debug Logging: Include mechanisms in the Arduino code for logging key events, errors, and status messages to facilitate troubleshooting.

Your final deliverable should include:

A complete wiring diagram and hardware list.

The full Arduino code with detailed inline comments.

Firebase setup instructions including database rules and schema.

A detailed project report/documentation covering design decisions, test cases, and troubleshooting steps.
